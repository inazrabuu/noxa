# NOXA

Noxa is a developer-focused automation framework (Internal Development Platform -IDP) designed to streamline software delivery, from project creation to deployment.  
It bridges the gap between **DevOps**, **platform engineering**, and **developer experience**, enabling teams to move faster with consistency, observability, and governance built-in.
